Work / Project Examples

  Capstone Project
  
    My team has the challenge of making an eCommerce website for a clothing store. We use JavaScript and Java. 
    I worked mostly on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. Also on some Java.
    (The repository is private but I can show the code in an interview).
    
  CalgaryHacks
  
    We worked on an app that tracks bus stops for a hackathon.
    I made the Java backend and some desktop frontend.

    I thought this article was very interesting because it explained how to make a simple React application.
    I like React and I want to use it in our Capstone project.
    
 Focus
 
  I would like to focus on frontend development at Critical Mass. I would make web applications using various JavaScript frameworks.
